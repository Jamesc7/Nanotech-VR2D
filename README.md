# VR + 2D Simulation for Advanced Drug Delivery Education - Dr. Roy Bergstrom (University of Rhode Island), Dr. Jie Shen (University of Rhode Island)

Objective: To develop a virtual reality simulation introducing students to the concept of advanced drug delivery systems, with an emphasis on nanotechnology including built-in quizzes for student evaluation.
Once completed, one group of students will go through this simulation and one group of students will learn the information in a traditional classroom setting. Data will be gathered on student performance, and comparisons will be made between the VR and non-VR group to determine whether VR can be used as an effective teaching tool.

Outcomes: (1) Provide students (high school and college students) with an alternative learning strategy for mastering basic concepts in advanced drug delivery applications.
(2) They will learn the history and background of nanotechnology, process of synthesizing nanotech, give studentâ€™s ability to test their knowledge by making decision as to which nanotech to use given disease state, and introduce students to common barriers to entry for nanotech in the body.
(3) Compare effectiveness of conventional teaching methods vs. more life-like VR simulation through built-in quizzes.
